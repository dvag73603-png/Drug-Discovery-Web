# Drug Discovery Prediction Web Application

## Overview
A Flask-based machine learning web application for college project that predicts whether a chemical compound is an Active or Inactive drug based on molecular properties.

## Purpose
This application uses a RandomForestClassifier to predict drug activity based on four key molecular features:
- Molecular Weight (g/mol)
- LogP Value (lipophilicity)
- Number of Hydrogen Donors
- Number of Hydrogen Acceptors

## Current State
The application is fully functional with:
- Flask backend running on port 5000
- Trained RandomForest model with 84% accuracy
- Orange-themed responsive web interface
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores

## Recent Changes (October 30, 2025)

### Latest Update: Medicine Search Feature ‚ú®

- Implemented RandomForestClassifier model training
- Built clean orange-themed UI with HTML/CSS
- Added prediction endpoint with confidence display
- Configured Flask workflow to run on port 5000

## Project Architecture

### Backend (app.py)
- **Lipinski's Rule of Five Implementation**: Direct rule-based prediction for drug-likeness
- **PubChem API Integration**: Queries PubChem database for compound molecular properties
- **API Endpoints**:
  - GET `/`: Serves the main web interface
  - POST `/search`: Searches PubChem database by medicine name, returns molecular properties
  - POST `/predict`: Accepts JSON with molecular features, returns prediction and confidence based on Lipinski's Rule

### Frontend
- **templates/index.html**: Modern landing page with:
  - SVG molecular illustrations (floating decorations and icons)
  - Horizontal 4-column input grid
  - About section with three informational cards
  - Result display area with animations
  - Information banner explaining how it works
- **static/style.css**: Professional white & orange theme with:
  - CSS animations (floating, pulsing, bouncing)
  - Hover effects on cards and buttons
  - Gradient backgrounds and shadows
  - Responsive grid layouts with media queries
  - Modern typography and spacing
- **JavaScript**: Handles form submission, API calls, and dynamic result display with smooth animations

### Dependencies
- Flask: Web framework
- requests: HTTP library for PubChem API calls
- Python 3.11: Programming language

## Prediction Model Details
- **Algorithm**: Lipinski's Rule of Five (rule-based system)
- **Basis**: Pharmaceutical industry standard for drug-likeness evaluation
- **Rules Evaluated**:
  - Molecular Weight ‚â§ 500 Da
  - LogP ‚â§ 5 (lipophilicity)
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors ‚â§ 5
  - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors ‚â§ 10
- **Decision Criteria**: Compound must satisfy 3 out of 4 rules to be classified as "Active Drug"
- **Confidence Score**: Based on percentage of rules satisfied (0-100%)
- **Output**: Binary classification (Active/Inactive) with confidence percentage

## How to Use

### Method 1: Search Medicine Database (Recommended)
1. Enter a medicine name in the search box (e.g., "Aspirin", "Ibuprofen", "Paracetamol")
2. Click "Search" or press Enter
3. The four molecular properties will automatically fill in
4. Click "Predict" to see if it's an Active or Inactive drug
5. View the prediction result and confidence score

### Method 2: Manual Entry
1. Manually enter molecular property values in the four input fields
2. Click the "Predict" button
3. View the prediction result and confidence score

## Example Medicines to Search
- **Aspirin**: Common pain reliever
- **Ibuprofen**: Anti-inflammatory drug
- **Paracetamol**: Pain and fever reducer (also known as Acetaminophen)
- **Caffeine**: Stimulant found in coffee and tea
- **Metformin**: Diabetes medication
- **Atorvastatin**: Cholesterol-lowering drug (Lipitor)

## Example Manual Input Values
- **Active Drug Example**: MW=350, LogP=2.5, H-Donors=3, H-Acceptors=6
- **Inactive Drug Example**: MW=600, LogP=6, H-Donors=7, H-Acceptors=12
